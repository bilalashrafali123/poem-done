            i have always been the thing <br>
            thats not like the other <br>
            
            the analogue touch <br>
            through digital screens,<br>
            
            the bougie drink <br>
            at a neighborhood dive, <br>
            
            the black ink <br>
            bringing anxious poems <br>
            to a comfortable <br>
            white sheet of paper. <br>
            
            so it would make sense <br>
            to be the only brown body <br>
            shopping on busy streets, <br>
            
            walking past <br>
            peach-skinned mannequins <br>
            that wear rainbow-colored threads, <br>
            
            staring out <br>
            from store-front windows, <br>
            stuck to each other <br>
            in a copy and paste culture, <br>
            void of color. <br>
            
            
            when was the last time <br>
            a mannequin had an expressive face <br>
            behind the mask? <br>
            
        
            behind the blank <br>
            glossy-eyed barrier <br>
            of a window glass? <br>
            
            when was the last time <br>
            you saw a black man <br>
            stand strong and unashamed <br>
            with his dark, holy features, <br>
            center-framed in a bleached-out world, <br>
            
            fully aware of being <br>
            the blurred-out version <br>
            of his true self? <br>
            
            
            I am a free token <br>
            for closed minds <br>
            who are broke with blind eyes, a splash, <br>
            a cool glass <br>
            for the sun’s predictable clash <br>
            with Charleston streets. <br>
            
            I am the man <br>
            without a mirror, <br>
            unable to look at himself <br>
            in a place <br>
            surrounded by the water’s reflection. <br>
            
            someone who is always seen as the “other” <br>
            in a copy and paste culture, <br>
            void of color. <br>
            
            
            I’m looking for memory coordinates <br>
            instead of road maps through familiar places, <br>
            
            I’m looking to unravel headphone cords <br>
            in a wireless world. <br>
            
            I’m looking for flesh-colored bandaids <br>
            that match my skin tone. <br>
            
            I’m looking <br>
            to not be so alone. </p>
