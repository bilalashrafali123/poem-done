            By day the bat is cousin to the mouse. <br>
            He likes the attic of an aging house. <br>
            
            His fingers make a hat about his head. <br>
            His pulse beat is so slow we think him dead. <br>
            
            He loops in crazy figures half the night <br>
            Among the trees that face the corner light. <br>
            
            But when he brushes up against a screen, <br>
            We are afraid of what our eyes have seen: <br>
            
            For something is amiss or out of place <br>
            When mice with wings can wear a human face. <br></p>
