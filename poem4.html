            April. And the air dry  <br>
            As the shoulders of a water buffalo.  <br>
            
            Grasshoppers scratch at the dirt,  <br>
            rub their wings with thin legs  <br>
            flaring out in front of the soldiers  <br>
            in low arcing flights, wings a blur.  <br>
            
            The soldiers donâ€™t notice anymore,  <br>
            seeing only the wreckage of the streets,  <br>
            bodies draped with sheets, and the sun,  <br>
            how bright it is, how hard and flat and white. <br>
            
            It will take many nails from the coffinmakers  <br>
            to shut out this light, which reflects off everything:  <br>
            the calloused feet of the dead, their bony hands,  <br>
            their pale foreheads so cold, brilliant in the sun.  <br></p>
