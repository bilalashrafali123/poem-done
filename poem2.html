            When some people talk about money <br>
They speak as if it were a mysterious lover <br>
Who went out to buy milk and never <br>
Came back, and it makes me nostalgic <br>
For the years I lived on coffee and bread, <br>
Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday <br>
Like a woman journeying for water <br>
From a village without a well, then living <br>
One or two nights like everyone else <br>
On roast chicken and red wine <br>
